# Q-DEMDE

Quantum-classical density matrix density estimation (Q-DEMDE) is a quantum-classical model for density estimation and anomaly detection on present-day quantum computers. Density estimation, a key task in statistics and machine learning, aims to determine the underlying probability density function of an observed dataset. The method leverages quantum hardware to construct a probability density function of a dataset using mixed quantum states and quantum Fourier features, introducing an algorithm for estimating the expected value of mixed density matrix from its spectral decomposition. Demonstrations on quantum simulators and real IBM quantum computers show promising results for density estimation and anomaly detection, highlighting the potential of quantum computing for machine learning tasks.
